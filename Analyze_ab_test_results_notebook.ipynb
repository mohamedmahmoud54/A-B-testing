We have three main stages of our analysis.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>First, we cleaned some quality issues we dropped the duplicated and the missing values, then We perform the hypothesis testing on the dataset to get the closest answer to the truth, we calculated the p-value(which i have explained before), the result of this test came against the new page.</strong> </li>\n<li><strong>We perform Z=testing in the third stage which again come against the new page.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>And the final stage was the logistic regression model here we the resulted was that the new page leads to only 1.015 than the old page, so here we can confidently say that there is no reason to lanch the new page because there is no obvius diffrence between conversion of the new and the old one and better design a new third page to increase the conversion rate, also we added the country column in another step to see it's impact nad we found out that users from UK are 0.95 times more likely to convert as compared to users from CA, while users from Us are 0.66 times more likely to more convert as compared to users from CA</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n"], "cell_type": "markdown"}, {"metadata": {}, "source": ["\n<p><a id=\"conclusions\"></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Finishing-Up\">Finishing Up<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Finishing-Up\">\u00b6</a></h2><blockquote><p>Congratulations!
